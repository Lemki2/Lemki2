> Please write a 500 word digital literacy narrative from the perspective of a 20 year old university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities. Include the strategies they currently employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Please offer your critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are discovering in the course as well as what you would like to learn.

RESPONSE:

Although I am not a great user of digital media, I do use technology for many of my goals, for example, I use websites to access books I want and then print them or read them on apps like PDF Drawboard, I use Canva to make designs like vision boards, quotes, CVs, and schedules. 
Recently, thanks to this class, I have also started to use platforms to analyze books such as Voyant, which, I find very intriguing and important because I can get to analyze and know a lot of things about a book without actually reading it, which saves my time and helps me choose the best books! Awesome, isn't it? 

I do not prefer using media much either, however, of course, I cherish the various opportunities that come with them. I usually prefer to talk to people like my family or friends through video calls so I use media like Google Meets or Zoom. I also do not like keeping up with news and recieving notifications because I do not like my attention getting controlled by the external world. 

I also use Excel to create schedules and sometimes to calculate things such as my overall grade in a subject which has many parts. For creating presentations, I mainly use Canva but sometimes Powerpoint as well, and I would like to work on this area more such as learning how to incorporate more stuff like objects, charts, and better designs.

The digital humanities course has introduced me to lots of fields in technology such as data mining and visualization. We have been using platforms like R or Posit Cloud and some others but I like Voyant the most because it is very easy to use and does a lot of job. In the beginning, we also were just focused on using Github, creating an account and forking this repository on which I am working right now. That is great about Github, that you can get data and edit, and even revert if you want as it has the aspect of saving versions.
I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been new and inspring. I have become more curious and interested in technology and areas such as data analysis and manipulation and visualization, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools for myself but also to get some good job done for others. I am looking forward to exploring more media and technological tools so that I will be able to create, modify, or present nice works and feel a meaning at doing this.
