RESPONSE:

Although I am not a great user of digital media, I do use technology for many of my goals, for example, I use websites to access books I want and then print them or read them on apps like PDF Drawboard, I use Canva to make designs like vision boards, quotes, CVs, and schedules. 
Recently, thanks to this class, I have also started to use platforms to analyze books such as Voyant, which, I find very intriguing and important because I can get to analyze and know a lot of things about a book without actually reading it, which saves my time and helps me choose the best books! Awesome, isn't it? 

I do not prefer using media much either, however, of course, I cherish the various opportunities that come with them. I usually prefer to talk to people like my family or friends through video calls so I use media like Google Meets or Zoom. I also do not like keeping up with news and recieving notifications because I do not like my attention getting controlled by the external world. 

I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and Adobe Spark to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
