Guiding questions: 
- What are the platforms you use?
- What are you good at in digital environments? 
- What can you use some improvement in? 
- What are you learning about new domains? 

> Please write a digital literacy narrative from the perspective of a 20 year old university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities. Include the strategies they currently employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Please offer your critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are discovering in the course as well as what you would like to learn.

RESPONSE:

### HOW I USE TECHNOLOGY
  I use technology for many of my goals and the more I use it, the more I come to appreciate it. Although, I have noticed that just like with everything else, this becomes robotic too. At first, technology enters our life suddenly and it seems fantastic but then it becomes normal, a part of our lives, a tool we use and rarely think about. This has been one of the main themes in this class, not just advancing in technology, but actually incorporating humanities and questioning, creativity, or just contemplation in general. 

  I use websites to access books I want and then print them or read them on apps like PDF Drawboard. I use Canva to make designs like vision boards, quotes, CVs, and schedules, and Sheets or Microsoft Excel to create timetables. I also use Excel to create schedules and sometimes to calculate things such as my overall grade in a subject. For creating presentations, I mainly use Canva but sometimes Powerpoint as well.

  I do not prefer using social media much, however, of course, I cherish the various opportunities that come with them. I usually prefer to talk to people like my family or friends through video calls so I use media like Google Meets or Zoom. I also do not like keeping up with news and recieving notifications because I do not like my attention getting controlled by the external world. However, as long as it is conscious, I have no problems with it.


### WHAT I HAVE LEARNT
 The digital humanities course has introduced me to lots of fields in technology such as data mining and visualization. We have been using platforms like R or Posit Cloud and some others but I like Voyant the most because it is very easy to use and does a great job. In the beginning, we also were just focused on using Github, creating an account and forking this repository on which I am working right now. That is great about Github, that you can get data and edit, and even revert if you want as it has the aspect of saving versions. My curioosity for tech fields is increasing with all the new stuff coming in such as ChatGPT, AI, very skillful platforms, progressive 3rd printers, etc, and I wish to continue this exploration a bit more and then settle in one of the fields I like the most and learn more in depth while developing a passion about it. Recently, thanks to this class, I have also started to use platforms to analyze books such as Voyant, which, I find very intriguing and important because I can get to analyze and find out a lot of things about a book without actually reading it, which saves my time and helps me choose the best books! Awesome, isn't it? Furthermore, I can also create different data visualizations and even compare books! So far, this is the area I would like to to be at another level because I like working with books a lot and being able to be playful with, having control over data just sounds so exciting to me! For example, I found another platfrom which allowed me to export a book in a text file and I was able to do data analysis for it in Vuoyant. Soon, I am going to learn how to convert different files and similar things which will allow me to do as much data analysis as it is possible!

What I like about this course the most is that it has been focused on some specific things like using Voyant and Orange and having contemplations on these areas, and there have been so many other resources but we were given space to explore them on our own.
If I had to describe this course in one word, I would say it was "inspiring", such as when we created teams to analyze things like smell map or indian cookbook.

Now, I have started learning image analysis as well through one platform named Orange, which I find interesting to do but not as important as distant reading. However, learning about these and reflecting on their differences has broadened my understanding of data. I see image analysis as an activity of creativity more since it is not as explicit and I do not need it. Companies like Google however find this beneficial since images contribute in creating models for people and customizing their data in such a way that is profitable, gives people what they want, etc.


### MY REFLECTION ON DIGITAL HUMANITIES
  Furethrmore, it is interesting how humanities is important for the development of technology or rather how these are necessary for each other. While technology is developing rapidly, we have to recognize that it always has some forms of limitations. For example, HTR is great at recognizing handwritten text, however, it can only be used as a starting point because its accuracy rate is not very big. However, it is a great way to start and motivate oneself to do textual analysis, and there is always the option of training the platform to recognize the text better by editing the text it gives. OveralL, I really do like development in this and similar areas **because this is how knowledge is becoming more and more accessible**. For example, I have been able to find some very deep and worthwhile life teachings such as that of David Hawkins and Eckhart Tolle, which now I would actually want to level up and look more deeply into their books while creatively mining, comparing,relating, and visualizing, and coming up with new data or visualizations. I greatly wonder what person I would be had I not had access to the wisdom I have found through internet. Although, there is so much I would like to do, i believe it would be best if I focus on something. For now, I want to continue learning how to use Github and create a site where I can research about "presence" and increasing one's mental vibration, and continue to learn coding step by step. I really like this idea of learning a skill through tying it to something I have passion about and interest in. They would reinforce each other.
  
> "The core belief of these lessons is that no digital work should be done simply through technical means. All activities should combine critical understanding with hands-on work. To separate critical reflection from methods is to turn human beings into mere instruments of automation, or to make humanists serve agendas at odds with their core beliefs and values. Instead, we should aspire to make automated processes engage more fully with humanistic capabilities for interpretation and responsible judgment in the service of equity across diverse populations and cultures." (Drucker, 7). 
> Similarly, the importance of this has been discussed in Berry's book too, where they emphasize the importance of reasoning besides having technical skills such as knowing how to write a program. I strongly agree with this, firstly because staying conscious and intentional, and doing something with contemplation is crucial for doing something worthwhile. After all, we are not looking for only efficiency, right? We have to constantly keep asking ourselves: "What is the purpose of that which we do?". For example, what is the purpose of efficiency? To make life easier. What is the purpose of making life easier? and so on... If we do not have an understanding of ourselves and sre not fully conscious of our intentions, what is the point of creating machines which can do great job. **What I have to say about this is only that we have to be careful not to lose ourselves in automatocity in this journey of automatising everything. **

  
  In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been fresh, creative, and inspring. I have become more curious and interested in technology and areas such as data analysis, manipulation, and visualization, textual analysis, and even think about these matters and how they relate to our lives. I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools for myself and also to get some good job done for others. I am looking forward to exploring more media and technological tools so that I will be able to create, modify, or present nice works and feel a meaning at doing this.
