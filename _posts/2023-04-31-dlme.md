## Introduction
This is a project about artistic data from a digital library and their metadata, for the course Introduction to Digital Humanities, which is created on a Github repository.

## What projects have you chosen from the Digital Library of the Middle East?

I have chosen two artworks, paintings: "Sufi sage" and "Walking yogini". I have found it very intriguing how even after using the same painntings, the pantings do look very different. 

[Sufi sage] (https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/harvard_scw-7203)

[Walking yogini] (https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/harvard_scw-7039)

## What are the similarities between these two works?

1. These are both painings and they are held in the same institution, at "Fine Arts Library, Harvard University" besides being provided by the Library at Harvard as well. 
2. In the subject of these paintings, although the object is different, the same theme is found, which is Islamic art. Also, they are shown their sizes in the metadata.
3. The materials used to create these paintings are the same too: paper, gold, and opaque watercolor. 
4. They have been created almost on the same time, around 16th century.

## What about the differences?

- The first painting is about a sufi sage, a male representative in islamic mysticism.
- The second painting is about a yogini, a female representative in yogic or hindu mysticism. 
- The first one has the author visible. which is Farrukh Beg, Persian painter, born ca.1547, died after 1615, active in India, Mansur, Indian painter (artist).
- The first one is painted more carefully and that is why objects in it can be emphasized more. Plus their styles differ and I noticed that in the Sufi painting other than the Sufi, other objects are mostly secular or cultural such as vases, glass, clock, oil lamp, etc, whereas in the Yogini painting, we can see twi mosques and some other buildings, which is not only religious but belongs to Islam specifically, which makes me think that the author might have some message of these religions not contradicting each other, from a mystic perspective. This also gave me the idea to search about the author.
- The way the sufi is presented is very different from that of the yogini, with the latter being more open and revealing. It seems the painter wants to show a man who is normal, wearing traditional clothes, or maybe even ascetic, whereas in the other, yogini is only wearing few clothes and is also embellished with earrings, bracelets, and other jewlery. This is intriguing because both of these are into the spiritual domain, and yet they represent their objects differently.
- Yoginin has some additional information such as "Type", which seems to rather share some of key and descriptive words about the painting such as: still image, painting, detached leaves, albums...

## What happens when searching for these art works?

The painting Sufi sage seems to be more popular as it appears directly through a search. Through this, I was able to find even more information about the painting such as its name "Sufi sage in sorrow", which is way more specific descrition than just Sufi sage for this painting and also the painting itself is fuller than the version in DLME. This also helped me to look at and analyze the painting better. Indeed, it seems like the Sufi is so absorbed in his pain that he cannot notice the world outside much, and even a cat spilling the milk seems like nothing. He is sitting alone and looking with an apathetic and grieving eyesight. 

The other one seems less popular, however when adding the word "painting" in the search, it appeared as well. Again, I found other information about it which is that the yogini is sitting on stool, with a dog walking beside her and holding a manuscript and flowers in her hands. _I also found the option of zooming a picture while its quality is not lost very helpful in this analysis._
Something interesting I noticed is that both images in DLME have their edges cut, which actually have some persian/arabic text on them. 

## Adding the search about the author
> Doing this was very helpful because it confirms some of the reflections which I made on the Sufi painting. It seems that the broader we search about something, the more we can get the big picture of it. I am surprised how I did not search about the author before because this is one of the main metadata, if not the most, about any work. So, Farrukh Beg seems to be a "manuscript painter", which I learnt just now that it means someone who paints key scenes in Indian books, mainly historical, cultural, religious, and travel ones. What I got to confirm is that he has paintings have a tone of melancholy, which can also be noticed when looking at his other paintings. Most of them are men with the clothing similar to sufi gowns and with long beards. 

For example this one, which looks like a man who is disgusted by the world, utterly tired, and miserable.

Additional part:
> What is the importance of metadata to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries?  How complete are they usually? What is the cost of metadata? How can we make it better? 

> Similar to the way metaphysics expands our understanding of the world that physics cannot, I find metadata as important with regards to data. Metadata is actually simpler and very important for many reasons, especially when it comes to cultural objects in digital libraries because through having data about data or the content that we are working with, we can maxmimize the ways we organize and use the large and diverse contents while making them easily accessible to other people as well. It is only through condensed or simplified data about our big materials which can increase the control we exercise over that material such as, size of files, time of file creation, data quality, etc. The more metadata we have, the easier it will be for us to classify our content and thus find them as well. 
For example, in the Digital Library of the Middle East, the data there was easily discoverable thanks to the metadata which allowed its classification, which mainly was based on the type of the data such as sound, text, or image, the collection to which it belongs. based on content such as manuscript, photography, or arts.
Metdata are not always complete usually but with the advancement of technology, the importance and usage of metadata is increasing also. 
Metadata is great unless it is used by someone else such as social media using these to create models for people's identities. We could contribute to the metadata in such platforms like digital libraries, for example adding the information that I found about the paintings in there, but because we cannot know easily if the data from some other place is true, it is only in the hands of the data providers and maybe the holding institutions to make sure to have as much data about their content.
