## What projects have you chosen from the Digital Library of the Middle East?

I have chosen two artworks, paintings: "Sufi sage" and "Walking yogini". I have found it very intriguing how even after using the same painntings, the pantings do look very different. 

[Sufi sage] (https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/harvard_scw-7203)

[Walking yogini] (https://dlmenetwork.org/library/catalog/harvard_scw-7039)

## What are the similarities between these two works?

1. These are both painings and they are held in the same institution, at "Fine Arts Library, Harvard University" besides being provided by the Library at Harvard as well. 
2. In the subject of these paintings, although the object is different, the same theme is found, which is Islamic art. 
3. The materials used to create these paintings are the same too: paper, gold, and opaque watercolor. 
4. They have been created almost on the same time, around 16th century.

## What about the differences?

- The first painting is about a sufi sage.
- The second painting is about a yogini. 
- The first one has the author visible. which is Farrukh Beg, Persian painter, born ca.1547, died after 1615, active in India, Mansur, Indian painter (artist).
- The first one is painted more carefully and that is why objects in it can be emphasized more.
